Fake Update for MacOs!
=================

This project is designed to bring a fun and harmless prank to your colleagues who forget to lock their screens. With this fake macOS update, you can add a touch of humor to their day!

Simply wait for the perfect moment when your coworker steps away from their computer (perhaps during lunch break), open a browser, and navigate to [update-generator.com](http://www.update-generator.com/).

Once there, you can simulate a convincing macOS update screen and playfully lock their screen, giving them a surprise when they return!

Have a great time pranking your colleagues while spreading some laughter in the office!
